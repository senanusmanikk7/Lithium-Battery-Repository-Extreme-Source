Why lithium battery

Replace your outdated lead acid, gel and AGM batteries with a battery from Lithium Battery Power, one of the world's leading manufacturers of lithium-ion batteries.
JBBATTERY lithium-ion batteries are compatible with any application powered by lead acid, gel or AGM batteries. The integrated BMS (Battery Management System) installed in our lithium batteries is programmed to ensure that our cells can withstand high levels of abuse without battery failure. The BMS was designed to maximize battery performance, automatically balancing cells, avoiding any excessive charging or discharging.

JBBATTERY batteries can be operated for start-up or deep cycle applications and perform well in series and parallel connections. Any application that requires light, reliable, high-quality lithium batteries can be supported by our batteries and their integrated BMS.

JBBATTERY lithium batteries are ideal for energy-consuming applications. Specifically designed to work in high-intensity, multi-shift storage applications, lithium batteries offer significant advantages over outdated lead-acid technology. JBBATTERY batteries charge faster, work longer, last longer and are virtually maintenance-free.

What can this mean for your business? Fewer replacements, lower labor costs and less downtime.
